    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "Exposure to social media is negatively correlated to self reported happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment\n",
    "The subject will use [Memair DNS](https://memair.com/dns) on their computer & mobile device to pseudorandomly block social media on 50% of days. Every morning of the experiment, the subject will self report their happiness on a scale from 0 to 10 using [Memair emotions](https://memair.com/emotions/new). The nature of the pseduorandonly blocking leads to runs of blocked days followed by runs of unblocked days. In order to counter cross-over effect, the first two days after a state change (from blocked to unblocked or vice versa) will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment will start on the 4th of May and run for 60 days."
