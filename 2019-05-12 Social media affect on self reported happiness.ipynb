    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "Exposure to social media is negatively correlated to self reported happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment\n",
    "The subject ([Greg](https://gregology.net)) will pseudorandomly block social media on 50% of days (UTC based) using [Memair DNS](https://memair.com/dns) on their computer & mobile device. At 17:00 local (21:00 UTC) on each day of the experiment, the subject will be remined to self report their happiness on a scale from 0 to 10 in [Memair emotions](https://memair.com/emotions/new). Measurements will only be considered valid if they occur between 17:00 to 20:00 local (21:00 to 00:00 UTC). The nature of the pseduorandonly blocking leads to runs of blocked days followed by runs of unblocked days. In order to counter cross-over effect, the first two days after a state change (from blocked to unblocked or vice versa) will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment will start on the 12th of May and run for 60 days."
